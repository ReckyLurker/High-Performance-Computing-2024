# High-Performance-Computing-2024

This folder contains defintion of the solvers for solving the system of linear equations $Ax = B$. 
The iterative solvers currently implemented: 

1. Jacobi  
2. Gauss Seidel 
3. Successive Over Relaxation (SOR) based Gauss Seidel 
4. Steepest Descent 
5. Minimum Residual (MR)
6. Conjugate Gradient (CG) 
7. Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized (BiCGSTAB)

The list is ever growing and more solvers might be added in the future. The solvers are based on OpenBLAS and Armadillo.
